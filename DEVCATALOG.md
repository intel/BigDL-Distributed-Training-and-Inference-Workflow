# Distributed Training & Inference Workflows using BigDL 

## Introduction

Usually one would take many efforts to develop distributed training and inference pipelines to handle large datasets in production.
With the adoption of BigDL, AI workflows written in Python notebooks running on a single laptop can be seamlessly
scaled out across large clusters so as to process distributed big data.

Learn to use BigDL to easily build and seamlessly scale distributed training and inference workflows
for TensorFlow and PyTorch. This page takes the recsys workflows for Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) as an example.

Check out more workflow examples and reference implementations in the [Developer Catalog](https://developer.intel.com/aireferenceimplementations).

## Solution Technical Overview

Highlights and benefits of BigDL are as follows:

- Easily build efficient in-memory, distributed data analytics and AI pipelines that runs on a single Intel® Xeon cluster.
- Seamlessly scale TensorFlow and PyTorch applications to big data platforms.
- Directly deploy solutions on production Hadoop/YARN and Kubernetes clusters.


For more details, visit the BigDL [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main) and
[documentation page](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Validated Hardware Requirements

BigDL and the workflow example shown below could run widely on Intel® Xeon® series processors.

The architecture above illustrates how BigDL can build end-to-end, distributed and in-memory pipelines on Intel® Xeon clusters.

- BigDL supports loading data from various distributed data sources and data formats that are widely used in the big data ecosystem.
- BigDL supports distributed data processing with Spark DataFrame, Ray Dataset and provides APIs for distributed data parallel processing of Python libraries.
- BigDL supports seamlessly scaling many popular deep learning frameworks and includes runtime optimizations on Xeon.

## Get Started

### 1. Prerequisites

You are highly recommended to use the toolkit under the following system and software settings:
- OS: Linux (including Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 and CentOS 7) or Mac
- Python: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

### 2. Download the Workflow Repository
Create a working directory for the example workflow of BigDL and clone the [Main
Repository](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL) repository into your working
directory. This step downloads the example scripts in BigDL to demonstrate the workflow.
Follow the steps in the next section to easily install BigDL via [Docker](#31-install-from-docker) or [pip](#32-install-from-pypi-on-bare-metal).

```
mkdir ~/work && cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL.git
cd BigDL
```

### 3. Installation
You can install BigDL either using our provided [Docker image](#31-install-from-docker) (recommended way) or on [bare metal](#32-install-from-pypi-on-bare-metal) according to your environment and preference.

If you wish to run with `docker compose` or `helm`, we also provide you with easy scripts which lanuch the workflow automatically. After setting up Docker, you can just skip the remaining part of this section and directly go to [docker compose](#1-run-with-docker-compose) or [helm on k8s](#2-run-with-helm-on-k8s) instructions.

#### 3.1 Install from Docker
Follow these instructions to set up and run our provided Docker image.
For running the training workflow on bare metal, see the [bare metal instructions](#32-install-from-pypi-on-bare-metal).

**a. Set Up Docker Engine**

You'll need to install Docker Engine on your development system.
Note that while **Docker Engine** is free to use, **Docker Desktop** may require
you to purchase a license.  See the [Docker Engine Server installation
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) for details.

If the Docker image is run on a cloud service, mention they may also need
credentials to perform training and inference related operations (such as these
for Azure):
- [Set up the Azure Machine Learning Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/machine-learning)
- [Configure the Azure credentials using the Command-Line Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
- [Compute targets in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-target)
- [Virtual Machine Products Available in Your Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=virtual-machines&regions=us-east)

**b. Set Up Docker Image**

Pull the provided Docker image:
```
docker pull intelanalytics/bigdl-orca:latest
```

**c. Create Docker Container**

Create the Docker container for BigDL using the ``docker run`` command, as shown below. If your environment requires a proxy to access the Internet, export your
development system's proxy settings to the Docker environment by adding `--env http_proxy=${http_proxy}` when you create the docker container.
```
docker run -a stdout \
  --name bigdl-workflow \
  --env http_proxy=${http_proxy} \
  --env https_proxy=${https_proxy} \
  --env no_proxy=${no_proxy} \
  --volume ${PWD}:/workspace \
  --workdir /workspace \
  --privileged --init -it \
  intelanalytics/bigdl-orca:latest \
  bash
```

**d. Install Packages in Docker Container**

Run these commands to install additional software used for the workflow in the Docker container:
```
pip install tensorflow==2.9.0
```


#### 3.2 Install from Pypi on Bare Metal
Follow these instructions to set up and run this workflow on your own development
system. For running the training workflow with a provided Docker image, see the [Docker
 instructions](#31-install-from-docker).


**a. Set Up System Software**

Our examples use the ``conda`` package and environment on your local computer.
If you don't have ``conda`` installed, see the [Conda Linux installation
instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html).

**b. Install Packages in Conda Environment**

Run these commands to set up the workflow's ``conda`` environment and install required software:
```
conda create -n bigdl python=3.9 --yes
conda activate bigdl
pip install --pre --upgrade bigdl-orca-spark3
pip install tensorflow==2.9.0
```

---

## How To Run

### Manual Run
Follow these instructions to run the workflow by hand. If you wish to lanuch the workflow via scripts, see [docker compose](#1-run-with-docker-compose) or [helm on k8s](#2-run-with-helm-on-k8s) instructions.
#### 1. Download the Datasets

This workflow uses the [ml-100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) of [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/).

```
cd python/orca/tutorial/NCF
wget https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
unzip ml-100k.zip
```


#### 2. Run Workflow
The workflow uses Spark DataFrame to process the movielens data and defines the [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031) model in TensorFlow. Use these commands to run the workflow:
- Distributed training:
```
python tf_train_spark_dataframe.py --dataset ml-100k
```
- Distributed inference:
```
python tf_predict_spark_dataframe.py --dataset ml-100k
```

### Run Via Scripts
We offer two options to automatically launch the distribute training and inference workflow:
+ Docker Compose
+ Helm on K8s

#### 1. Run with `docker compose`

```bash
docker compose up bigdl-workflow --build

# After completion
docker compose down
```

#### 2. Run with `helm` on K8s:

Follow the official instructions to install [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) first before running the following commands on your Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
helm upgrade --install bigdl-workflow kubernetes/

# After completion
helm delete bigdl-workflow
```

## Expected Output
Check out the processed data, saved model and predictions of the workflow:
```
ll train_processed_dataframe.parquet
ll test_processed_dataframe.parquet
ll test_predictions_dataframe.parquet
ll NCF_model.h5
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter the error `E0129 21:36:55.796060683 1934066 thread_pool.cc:254] Waiting for thread pool to idle before forking` during the training, it may be caused by the installed version of grpc. See [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32196) for more details about this issue. To fix it, a recommended grpc version is 1.43.0:
```bash
pip install grpcio==1.43.0
```
